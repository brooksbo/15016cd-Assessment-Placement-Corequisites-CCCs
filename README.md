## Project overview: 

The "A New Era of Student Access at California's Community Colleges" project uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to assess how campus policy reforms in the realm of assessment and placement and in the realm of course offerings/curriculum are helping or hindering student-level outcomes at campuses across California's community college system.

The research utilizes information from a comprehensive scan of catalogs, websites, and administrative documents from all 114 California community colleges, as well as student-level longitudinal data provided by the California Community College Chancellor's Office. Information from the scan is merged onto the student-level longitudinal data system in order to analyze how college-level characteristics are associated with student performance in key metrics including but not limited to throughput (i.e. the share of a group of students that complete a given course), credit accumulation, degree attainment, and transfer.
